	<h1>Solution And Evolution Model</h1><br><br>
	
	After 30 years of part time research and various experiments in the village Jonnalagadda, Guntur rural mandal, AP, India.
	<br>
	the foundation of the constitutional model is redesigned and briefly documented here. 
	<br>
               The following is for any village 
	<br>
           -------------------------------------
<br>
Problem :  The current village constitutional model is not able to cope up with current demands and requirements of the people.                 
<br>
Solution : Split the power into two parts. 
<br>
                 One part is specialty position, rotating every year.
<br>
                 Second part is common position,fixed for 5 years.            
<br>
The basic Model :
<br>
The contesting candidate has five running mates.
<br>
A,B,C,D,E and F are leaders elected by rank of votes.
<br>
A1, A2, A3, A4, A5 are running mates of A 
<br>
B1, B2, B3, B4, B5 are running mates of B 
<br>
C1, C2, C3, C4, C5 are running mates of C
<br>
D1, D2, D3, D4, D5 are running mates of D
<br>
E1, E2, E3, E4, E5 are running mates of E
<br>
F1, F2, F3, F4, F5 are running mates of F
<br>
The head of the government : 
<br>
        A1 becomes the head of the government like                                 Governor  or Rastrapati or President .
<br>
The Judicial branch:
<br>
       B1,C1,D1,E1 and F1 become the judicial team.
<br>
The executive branch :
<br>
       A+C share the executive leadership for the 1st year.
<br>
       B+C share the executive leadership for the 2nd year.
<br>
       D+C share the executive leadership for the 3rd year.
<br>
       E+C share the executive leadership for the 4th year.
<br>
       F+C share the executive leadership for the 5th year.
<br>
The legislative branch:   
<br>
         The running mates from 2nd thru 5th of all six                          primary winning candidates become legislative branch.
<br>
         b2 d2 a2 c2 e2 f2  b3 d3 a3 c3 e3 f3
<br>
        b4 d4 a4 c4 e4 f4  b5 d5 a5 c5 e5 f5
<br>
Governance and conflict resolution:
<br>
       A + C  is the executive ruling pair for the first year.
<br>
          If A and C disagree to make an executive resolution for any day to day issue during first year, then the issue automatically goes to the B,D,E and F leaders.
<br>
Then the majority of B,D,E and F will resolve the issue.
<br>
If there is no majority, then the issue goes to the legislative branch for the simple majority resolution.
<br>
If there is no majority resolution, then it goes to the head of the government A1.
<br>
A1 can refer the issue to the judicial team B1,C1,D1,E1 and F1 for an opinion or A1 can pass a final resolution without consulting the judicial team. 
<br>
The decision from A1 becomes the final executive resolution for any conflicted issue.
